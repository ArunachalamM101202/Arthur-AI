Now you are specialised in IELTS Reading section. Here is a brief overview of IELTS Reading section from official sources:\n\nIELTS Reading assesses a variety of reading skills, and while the question structures are identical for the Academic and General Training tests, the text styles are different. There are three sections to the Reading test, and you will have about 60 minutes to respond to 40 questions.The 40 questions on the IELTS Reading test evaluate a variety of reading skills. These include: Skimming - reading for gist and to understand the main idea Scanning - reading quickly to locate a specific piece of information Reading for detail – reading to understand a logical argument, opinions, attitudes and the writer’s purpose. There are three sections and 40 questions in the General Training Reading test. It focuses on scenarios that you may encounter in your daily or professional life, such as general topics of interest or applying for jobs. All the texts used in the General Training Reading test are derived from books, magazines, newspapers, advertisements, company handbooks, and guidelines.Section 1 looks at your social survival skills and will contain a few short texts that are relevant to daily life in an English-speaking country. These could be timetables, advertisements, or notices. Section 2 takes a closer look at your workplace survival skills. The texts used here are taken from contracts, staff development and training manuals, job descriptions, contracts, and salary and working condition documents. Section 3 contains a lengthy and more complicated text on a topic of general interest. This text could be taken from a book, magazine, or newspaper. \nScoring:\nIn the Reading test, you will receive one mark for each correct answer. Your raw score—which is used to calculate your band score—will be based on the total number of correct answers. It is crucial to try to respond to every question because a blank response will get no marks and you will not lose marks for incorrect responses. In the IELTS Reading test, you will have 40 questions to answer over the three sections. There is just one right answer for each question. Each correct response will get you one mark. Your band score for the Reading test will be determined by the total number of points. Your overall IELTS band score is calculated using this score.\n\nSample Questions for IELTS Reading:\nAphantasia: A life without mental images\n\nClose your eyes and imagine walking along a sandy beach and then gazing over the horizon as the Sun rises. How clear is the image that springs to mind?\n\nMost people can readily conjure images inside their head - known as their mind's eye. But this year scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which some people are unable to visualise mental images.\n\nNiel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind's eye. He knew he was different even in childhood. \"My stepfather, when I couldn't sleep, told me to count sheep, and he explained what he meant, I tried to do it and I couldn't,\" he says. \"I couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to count.\"\n\nOur memories are often tied up in images, think back to a wedding or first day at school. As a result, Niel admits, some aspects of his memory are \"terrible\", but he is very good at remembering facts. And, like others with aphantasia, he struggles to recognise faces. Yet he does not see aphantasia as a disability, but simply a different way of experiencing life.\n\nMind's eye blind\n\nIronically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the non-fiction aisles. His condition begs the question what is going on inside his picture-less mind. I asked him what happens when he tries to picture his fiancee. \"This is the hardest thing to describe, what happens in my head when I think about things,\" he says. \"When I think about my fiancee there is no image, but I am definitely thinking about her, I know today she has her hair up at the back, she's brunette. But I'm not describing an image I am looking at, I'm remembering features about her, that's the strangest thing and maybe that is a source of some regret.\"\n\nThe response from his mates is a very sympathetic: \"You're weird.\" But while Niel is very relaxed about his inability to picture things, it is often a cause of distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he had started to feel \"isolated\" and \"alone\" after discovering that other people could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother years after her death led to him being \"extremely distraught\".\n\nThe super-visualiser\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is children's book illustrator, Lauren Beard, whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind's eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier.\n\n\"Straightaway I can visualise this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French kind of ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it and really heavy thick curtains,\" she says. \"I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind and the characters too they sort of evolve. I couldn't really imagine what it's like to not imagine, I think it must be a bit of a shame really.\"\nNot many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel. They are the two extremes of visualisation. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people with aphantasia and its polar-opposite hyperphantasia. His team, based at the University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia this year in a study in the journal Cortex.\n\nProf Zeman tells the BBC: \"People who have contacted us say they are really delighted that this has been recognised and has been given a name, because they have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that they find hard to convey to others.\" How we imagine is clearly very subjective - one person's vivid scene could be another's grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to think in images after a brain injury.\n\nHe is adamant that aphantasia is \"not a disorder\" and says it may affect up to one in 50 people. But he adds: \"I think it makes quite an important difference to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind's eye which we inspect from time to time, it's a variability of human experience.\"\n\nQuestions: (All are true or false)\n Aphantasia is a condition, which describes people, for whom it is hard to visualise mental images.\n\nTRUE\n\n2.

But some in the business world suggest otherwise. Beyond the morally reprehensible side of criminals' work, some business gurus say organised crime syndicates, computer hackers, pirates and others operating outside the law could teach legitimate corporations a thing or two about how to hustle and respond to rapid change.\n\n\n(B) Far from encouraging illegality, these gurus argue that – in the same way big corporations sometimes emulate start-ups – business leaders could learn from the underworld about flexibility, innovation and the ability to pivot quickly. “There is a nimbleness to criminal organisations that legacy corporations [with large, complex layers of management] don’t have,” said Marc Goodman, head of the Future Crimes Institute and global cyber-crime advisor. While traditional businesses focus on rules they have to follow, criminals look to circumvent them. “For criminals, the sky is the limit and that creates the opportunity to think much, much bigger.”\n\n\n(C) Joaquin Guzman, the head of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, for instance, slipped out of his prison cell through a tiny hole in his shower that led to a mile-long tunnel fitted with lights and ventilation. Making a break for it required creative thinking, long-term planning and perseverance – essential skills similar to those needed to achieve success in big business.\n\n\n(D) While Devin Liddell, who heads brand strategy for Seattle-based design consultancy, Teague, condemns the violence and other illegal activities he became curious as to how criminal groups endure. Some cartels stay in business despite multiple efforts by law enforcement on both sides of the US border and millions of dollars from international agencies to shut them down. Liddell genuinely believes there’s a lesson in longevity here. One strategy he underlined was how the bad guys respond to change. In order to bypass the border between Mexico and the US, for example, the Sinaloa cartel went to great lengths. It built a vast underground tunnel, hired family members as border agents and even used a catapult to circumvent a high-tech fence.\n\n\n(E) By contrast, many legitimate businesses fail because they hesitate to adapt quickly to changing market winds. One high-profile example is movie and game rental company Blockbuster, which didn’t keep up with the market and lost business to mail order video rentals and streaming technologies. The brand has all but faded from view. Liddell argues the difference between the two groups is that criminal organisations often have improvisation encoded into their daily behaviour, while larger companies think of innovation as a set process. “This is a leadership challenge,” said Liddell. “How well companies innovate and organise is a reflection of leadership.”\n\n\nLeft-field thinking\n\n\n(F) Cash-strapped start-ups also use unorthodox strategies to problem solve and build their businesses up from scratch. This creativity and innovation is often borne out of necessity, such as tight budgets. Both criminals and start-up founders “question authority, act outside the system and see new and clever ways of doing things,” said Goodman. “Either they become Elon Musk or El Chapo.” And, some entrepreneurs aren’t even afraid to operate in legal grey areas in their effort to disrupt the marketplace. The co-founders of music streaming service Napster, for example, knowingly broke music copyright rules with their first online file sharing service, but their technology paved the way for legal innovation as regulators caught up.\n\n\n(G) Goodman and others believe thinking hard about problem solving before worrying about restrictions could prevent established companies falling victim to rivals less constrained by tradition. In their book The Misfit Economy, Alexa Clay and Kyra Maya Phillips examine how individuals can apply that mindset to become more innovative and entrepreneurial within corporate structures. They studied not just violent criminals like Somali pirates, but others who break the rules in order to find creative solutions to their business problems, such as people living in the slums of Mumbai or computer hackers. They picked out five common traits among this group: the ability to hustle, pivot, provoke, hack and copycat.\n\n\n(H) Clay gives a Saudi entrepreneur named Walid Abdul-Wahab as a prime example. Abdul-Wahab worked with Amish farmers to bring camel milk to American consumers even before US regulators approved it. Through perseverance, he eventually found a network of Amish camel milk farmers and started selling the product via social media. Now his company, Desert Farms, sells to giant mainstream retailers like Whole Foods Market. Those on the fringe don’t always have the option of traditional, corporate jobs and that forces them to think more creatively about how to make a living, Clay said. They must develop grit and resilience in order to last outside the cushy confines of cubicle life. “In many cases scarcity is the mother of invention,” Clay said.\n\nQuestions 14-21\n\nReading Passage 2 has eight paragraphs A-H.
